          <h2> 2 Weeks Pregnant</h2>
          <p>
            Think you’re 2 weeks pregnant? You might not be. Here’s why. Most
            OBs count pregnancy starting from the first day of your last
            menstrual period (LMP). Yep, that’s a week or two before you even
            get pregnant. We know it sounds totally weird, but it’s more
            accurate for doctors to estimate a due date this way. So if you
            think you conceived about two weeks ago, you’re probably at least
            four weeks pregnant—maybe even five. We give you permission to skip
            ahead to week four. If you really are in the second week of your
            cycle and are trying to conceive, we’ve got some advice right here
            for you. 2 Weeks Pregnant Symptoms Getting pregnant relies on timing
            sex for when you’re most fertile—this is probably in the two days
            before you ovulate and the day you actually ovulate. If you’ve got a
            regular 28-day cycle, chances are you ovulate on day 15. But who the
            heck has a regular 28-day cycle every month? At 2 weeks pregnant,
            symptoms of ovulation can clue you in on the best time to have sex
            and hopefully conceive a baby. You’re probably ovulating if you
            notice these signs at week 2 of pregnancy: “Egg white” cervical
            mucus. Sounds a little gross, but it’s true. Your cervical mucus
            becomes thin, clear, and stringy, like egg whites, as you near
            ovulation. This consistency helps sperm travel toward the egg.
            Better sense of smell. Believe it! Hormonal changes boost your
            ability to pick up different scents, which is probably nature’s way
            of helping you sniff out male pheromones in an effort to procreate.
            Breast soreness or tenderness. Hormone changes associated with
            ovulation can make your boobs feel slightly sore. Pelvic ache. As
            your ovary releases an egg, you might feel a little twinge in one
            side of your abdomen. This is the phenomenon known as
            Mittelschmerz—named for the doctor who first documented it. Light
            spotting. You might notice a small tinge of red or brown on your
            underwear around the time of ovulation. This happens when the
            follicle around the egg ruptures. If it’s actual bleeding though, it
            could be something else, such as an ectopic pregnancy, so let your
            doctor know if you experience something heavier than just spotting
            in between periods. Increased sex drive. You might “just know” that
            you’re ovulating and naturally get revved up for some baby-making
            sex. Cervical changes. If you check your cervix routinely—something
            women who chart often do—you may notice it becomes higher, softer,
            and more open when you’re ovulating. Some women buy an ovulation
            test to help them figure out when they might be most fertile. A
            low-tech strategy is to have sex every other day from about day 12
            to day 16 of your menstrual cycle—meaning toward the end of the
            second week to the beginning of the third.

            If you do conceive at 2 weeks pregnant, symptoms won’t appear right
            away. In fact, you won’t be able to find out for sure you’re if
            pregnant until there’s enough pregnancy hormones in your system for
            a home pregnancy test to detect. That should happen at about week 4,
            which is the same time you’ll probably miss your period. Around this
            time, those hormone levels are finally high enough that they give
            you some noticeable pregnancy symptoms. Some women swear they do
            start noticing early pregnancy signs before week 4 though; these are
            the ones that could clue you in: Spotting. About 5 to 10 days after
            conception, you may notice a little spotting. This is caused by the
            embryo implanting itself into your uterine wall. Frequent urination.
            Pregnancy hormones can cause you to take more trips to the bathroom
            in the first weeks of pregnancy. Sore boobs and/or darker areolas.
            Pretty much as soon as those hormones appear, a woman’s body starts
            prepping her boobs for breastfeeding. Fatigue. Total exhaustion is
            some women’s first clue they’re expecting. That’s because your body
            will use a ton of energy to grow baby. Morning sickness. Probably
            the most notorious pregnancy symptom, nausea usually begins to rear
            its ugly head around week 4 to week 9. Bloating. Yes, again. As your
            body starts to realize you’re pregnant, it will probably slow down
            the digestion process in an effort to deliver more nutrients to
            baby. This can result in a bit of gas and bloating—hey, maybe it
            will even look a bit like a 2 weeks pregnant belly! (Not that that
            exists!) Think you’re 2 weeks pregnant? You might not be. Here’s
