          <h2>1 Week Pregnant</h2>
          <p>
            Surprise! One week pregnant is actually not pregnant at all. Say
            what?! Most OBs count pregnancy starting from the first day of your
            last period. That's because ovulation and conception are really
            tough to pinpoint, but the physical signs of menstruation are much
            easier to spot. So in doctor speak, 1 week pregnant means you’re on
            your period and not yet pregnant. You won’t actually conceive your
            baby until week two or three, depending on the length of your cycle.
            If you’ve just found out you’re expecting, you might think this is
            your first week of pregnancy, but you’re probably around 4 weeks
            pregnant. Yes, already! (Your OB will give you a more accurate
            estimate when you go in for your first prenatal appointment.) Skip
            ahead and check out week 4.

          <h2>1 Week Pregnant Symptoms</h2>
          <p>
            At 1 week pregnant—remember at this early stage, the symptoms you're
            experiencing are those typical to your period because you're not
            actually pregnant. These symptoms may last from three to seven days,
            and can include: Vaginal bleeding. You body is shedding the uterine
            lining, which holds last month’s unfertilized egg. Lower back pain
            and cramps. To release that lining, your uterus contracts, causing
            your back and abdomen to ache. Bloating. Fluctuating hormones can
            give you a bloated belly right before and during your period. Mood
            swings. Those raging hormones can also cause irritability and wreak
            havoc on your emotions. Headache. Many women complain of menstrual
            migraines, which are also hormone related. (Surprise, surprise.) Ice
            packs, OTC pain relievers, and relaxation exercises may help ease
            the pain.

          <h2>1 Week Pregnant Belly</h2>
          <p>
            Inside your 1 week pregnant belly, your body isn’t only releasing
            last month’s egg. It begins to form a new uterine lining, which will
            hold next month’s egg. You know, the one that will hopefully get
            fertilized and grow and develop into a fetus?! Cool fact: Human eggs
            are the largest cells in the body. An egg is the size of peach fuzz.
            Your body will release one (or in rare cases, two) eggs somewhere
            between day 10 and day 19 of your menstrual cycle—or about 14 days
            before your next period is expected. It can be fertilized for about
            12 to 24 hours after that. Oh, and having sex before then is helpful
            too, since sperm can live in your body for up to six days. The first
            signs of pregnancy won’t occur right away—in fact, many women miss
            their period at week 4 before they even feel “different.” But some
            common early signs of pregnancy in the first weeks after
            fertilization include breast soreness or tenderness, nausea,
            fatigue, and frequent urge to pee. At one week pregnant (a.k.a.
            hoping to be pregnant soon!), you’re probably thinking about how you
            can prep your body to carry a baby. It’s a good idea to start
            pregnancy at a healthy weight and free of bad habits such as smoking
            and drinking. Reduce your caffeine intake to the equivalent of a cup
            of coffee or two (we’re talking 8 ounce cups—not the venti!) per
            day.
